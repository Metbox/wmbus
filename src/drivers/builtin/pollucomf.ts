// pollucomf — auto-generated registry stub.
// Source: upstream wmbusmeters driver definition.
//
// Registers the driver with correct MVTs and library fields so the registry
// resolves its name. Specialised field extraction + mfct-specific quirks are
// not yet ported; production traffic will populate the standard library
// fields and fall back to auto-driver behaviour for anything non-standard.
